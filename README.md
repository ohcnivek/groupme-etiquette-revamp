# Groupme Etiquette (Revamped)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & hosted on Vercel. 

# Context
Have you ever been in an inconvinient yet relevant GroupMe? The one where the same 10 people send messages every hour as if every time they clicked send, they didn't just notify 200 other people? If so, you're in the right place! 

If not, and you're just curious as to who in your friend group sends either the most controversial / funny messages, you're also in the right place!

# To Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` followed by `npm start`
